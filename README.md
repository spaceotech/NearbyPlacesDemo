Setting up Project

Google nearby API is one of the many APIs provided by google to get geographical information about nearby places like restaurants, gas stations, cafes, bars, hospitals using HTTP request.

For this, we need to pass the latitude and longitude coordinates of the location to know about the nearby places’ location. To get these data, we’ll need to [integrate Google nearby API](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/integrate-google-nearby-api-android-retrofit/).

In this Android app tutorial, we’ll show you how to get current location and then use Google nearby API to get location of nearby places.

Though, if you want to add further features, the implementation process can get tricky, and it’s better to consult with an [Android app development company](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) before you implement in your native Android app.
